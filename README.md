# TLA+ scratchwork

## Getting started

Install the IDE

```
brew cask install tla-plus-toolbox
```

Install CLI tools

After installing the toolbox, find the location of `tla2tools.jar`,
and modify the scripts in `scripts` to point to that jar. Note that
all CLI options and flags are single-hyphen, e.g.,

```
tlc -help
```
